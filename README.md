# Demo NFT Marketplace

Goals:
- Concise code
- Well typed
- Using react hooks + functional features
- easy to understand and use libraries
- Easy for other developers to contribute and leverage the code
- Fast. Server side rendering as much as possible
- Extensible. Code in this project is useful in many dapps or as providing inspiration

Tech stack:
- Typescript (default JS, typed where possible. Aiming for fully typed code)
- NextJs (React fairy dust. More is more. NextJs makes make aspects of react development a lot easier)
- Hardhat (Based smart contracts dev suite)
- Ethers (Because it's the standard library to interact with blockchain and is a well trodden library many developers have already navigated)
- Web3Modal (It's nice yeah.. I'm not happy with the wallet integration code yet. It's a mess **WIP**)
